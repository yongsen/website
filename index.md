# Projects
## Sign Language Recognition using WiFi and Convolutional Neural Networks
Source Code and Dataset

In this project, we propose SignFi to recognize frequently used sign gestures using WiFi signals. SignFi measures Channel State Information (CSI) by WiFi packets as the input and uses a 9-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the classification algorithm. It is able to recognize 276 sign gestures with 94.81% accuracy for CSI traces from lab and home environments.

## 802.11ax on NS3, Intel
IEEE 802.11ax is the next generation WiFi standard which aims at High Efficiency WLAN (HEW) in high density scenarios. This project includes an NS3 simulation model written in C++, some 802.11ax calibration results, and 5 patents. The related patents are listed below.

## Mobile 802.11n, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
This project exploits both packet and physical level metrics to get accurate and fast wireless measurement for mobile 802.11n networks. It was written in 2,000 lines of C code based on Qualcomm Atheros's wireless driver ath9k.

## GSM-R Monitoring, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
The GSM-R monitoring system passively monitors the wireless interface in real-time to improve the reliability of GSM-R in high-speed scenarios. The software was written in 4,000 lines of C#, and tested along the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway.

## Zigbee on NS2, Shandong University
This project provides a performance evaluation of Zigbee networks based on NS2. The deployment of Zigbee nodes is in a 3-D topology. It provides a NS2 simulation model written in tcl, and the evaluation script written in awk.
